# Wine Quality Evaluation

This project focuses on analyzing wine quality based on its physicochemical properties. Using machine learning, we develop a model to predict wine quality based on numerical attributes such as acidity, sugar content, pH level, and more.

## Overview

The project consists of the following key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, cleaning, and normalization.
2. **Data Analysis**: Visualizing relationships between different attributes.
3. **Modeling**: Building and training a machine learning model to predict wine quality.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Testing the model and analyzing its performance.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `photos/`: Directory with images used for visualizations.
- `main.py`: Main script for running the analysis and building the model.
- `quality_evaluation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with detailed analysis and data visualization.
- `quality_evaluation.py`: Module with functions for wine quality evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages for the project.

## Example of work

The photo shows the output of wine rating on a 10-point scale in Ukrainian language.
