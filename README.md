# Wine Quality Evaluation

This project focuses on analyzing wine quality based on its physicochemical properties. Using machine learning, we develop a model to predict wine quality based on numerical attributes such as acidity, sugar content, pH level, and more.

## Overview

The project consists of the following key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, cleaning, and normalization.
2. **Data Analysis**: Visualizing relationships between different attributes.
3. **Modeling**: Building and training a machine learning model to predict wine quality.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Testing the model and analyzing its performance.
